This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies from the package.json by running:
```bash
npm install
#or
yarn
```
Then, you can run a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
if you do not want to run a development server, you can build the pages inorder to make the rendering faster by running:

```bash
npm run build

#if build was succesfully, you can then run 

npm run start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. if you have something running on port 3000, it switches to port 3001.
